As a challenge and a learning experience I tried making my own C++ 2D engine from scratch.
It has gone through a couple iterations, most recently I replaced SFML with OpenGL

I should stress, this project is NOT about making the best engine I can, it is a learning experiance.
I wrote my own Parent-child system, my own memory management, my own 2d physics and my own matix class and all the math related to it.
I realize that for most of these approaches significantly better resources exist, but then I would not learn neaarly as much.
